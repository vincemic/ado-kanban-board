# Team-Based Area Path Filtering Test

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented team-based area path filtering for the Azure DevOps Kanban Board application. Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Azure DevOps API Integration**:
   - Added support for the Azure DevOps Work API `teamfieldvalues` endpoint
   - API endpoint: `/{organization}/{project}/{team}/_apis/work/teamsettings/teamfieldvalues?api-version=7.1`
   - This endpoint returns the area paths that a team subscribes to, including whether they include child areas

2. **Enhanced Data Models**:
   - Added `TeamFieldValues` interface to represent the API response
   - Added `TeamFieldValue` interface for individual team field values
   - Updated the `Team` interface to properly handle area paths

3. **Improved Azure DevOps Service**:
   - Modified `loadTeams()` to fetch team field values for each team
   - Added `getTeamFieldValues()` method to call the Work API
   - Added `loadTeamAreaPaths()` method to load area paths for all teams in parallel
   - Used `forkJoin` to wait for all team area path requests to complete

4. **Enhanced Filtering Logic**:
   - Updated the `filteredWorkItems` computed signal to properly filter work items based on team area paths
   - Added support for hierarchical area path matching (child area paths)
   - Work items are now filtered to show only those belonging to the selected team's area paths

### How It Works

1. When a team is selected (or defaulted), the system retrieves the team's configured area paths from Azure DevOps
2. These area paths define which work items the team "owns" or subscribes to
3. The kanban board then filters work items to show only those that match the team's area paths
4. The filtering supports both exact matches and hierarchical matches (when a team includes child areas)

### API Documentation Validation

The implementation follows the official Azure DevOps REST API documentation:
- **Endpoint**: `/{organization}/{project}/{team}/_apis/work/teamsettings/teamfieldvalues`
- **API Version**: 7.1
- **Purpose**: Gets a collection of team field values (typically area paths)
- **Response**: Returns the area paths that a team subscribes to, along with whether they include child areas

### Example Response Structure
```json
{
  "field": {
    "referenceName": "System.AreaPath",
    "url": "https://dev.azure.com/org/_apis/wit/fields/System.AreaPath"
  },
  "defaultValue": "Project\\Team",
  "values": [
    {
      "value": "Project\\Team",
      "includeChildren": false
    },
    {
      "value": "Project\\Team\\SubArea",
      "includeChildren": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Testing

The implementation includes:
- Mock service support for testing without Azure DevOps connection
- Proper error handling with fallback to default area paths
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- Reactive UI updates using Angular signals

### Benefits

1. **Accurate Filtering**: Work items are now filtered based on the actual team configuration in Azure DevOps
2. **Hierarchical Support**: Teams can include child area paths, and the filtering respects this configuration
3. **Real-time Updates**: The filtering updates immediately when team selection changes
4. **Error Resilience**: Falls back gracefully if team area paths cannot be loaded
5. **Performance**: Uses parallel requests to load team configurations efficiently

This implementation ensures that when a team is selected, only the work items that belong to that team's configured area paths are displayed on the kanban board, providing a focused view for each team.
