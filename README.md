# Azure DevOps Kanban Board

A modern Angular application that provides a Kanban-style interface for managing Azure DevOps work items with drag-and-drop functionality.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.2.

## Features

- üîê **Authentication**: Connect to any Azure DevOps organization using Personal Access Tokens
- üìã **Kanban Board**: Visual board with columns representing work item states
- üéØ **Drag & Drop**: Move work items between states with intuitive drag-and-drop
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Work Item Management**: Create, edit, and delete work items
- üè∑Ô∏è **Rich Metadata**: Support for work item types, priorities, tags, and assignments
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- üé® **Material Design**: Modern UI using Angular Material components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm
- An Azure DevOps organization and project
- Personal Access Token with Work Items (read & write) permissions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ado-kanban-board
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

### Azure DevOps Setup

1. Go to your Azure DevOps organization
2. Navigate to **User Settings** > **Personal Access Tokens**
3. Create a new token with **Work Items (read & write)** permissions
4. Copy the token for use in the application

### Using the Application

1. **Login**: Enter your Azure DevOps organization name and Personal Access Token
2. **Mock Mode**: Toggle mock mode for testing with sample data (no real Azure DevOps connection required)
3. **View Board**: See your work items organized in columns by state
4. **Drag & Drop**: Move work items between columns to change their state
5. **Create Work Items**: Click the "New Work Item" button to add new items
6. **Edit Work Items**: Click on any work item to edit its details
7. **Refresh**: Use the refresh button to reload data from Azure DevOps

### Mock Mode for Testing

The application includes a mock mode for testing purposes:

- **URL Parameter**: Add `?mock=true` to the URL to enable mock mode
- **Toggle Button**: Use the toggle button on the login page to switch between real and mock modes
- **Sample Data**: Mock mode provides realistic sample work items and projects
- **Local Storage**: Your mock mode preference is saved locally

Mock mode is perfect for:
- Testing the application without Azure DevOps access
- Demonstrating functionality
- Development and debugging
- E2E testing

## Quick Testing

### Test with Mock Data (No Azure DevOps Required)

1. Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200?mock=true`

3. Or use the toggle button on the login page to switch to mock mode

4. When in mock mode:
   - Organization name can be anything (e.g., "testorg")
   - PAT token can be anything (e.g., "fake-token")
   - You'll see sample projects and work items
   - All drag-and-drop functionality works with mock data

### Test with Real Azure DevOps

1. Ensure you have an Azure DevOps organization and PAT token
2. Start the application normally: `ng serve`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`
4. Enter your real organization name and PAT token
5. Connect to your actual Azure DevOps projects


```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 18+**: Latest version with standalone components
- **Angular Material**: UI component library
- **Angular CDK**: Drag & drop functionality
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Azure DevOps REST API**: Work item management

## API Integration

The application integrates with the Azure DevOps REST API to:

- Query work items using WIQL (Work Item Query Language)
- Update work item states
- Create new work items
- Retrieve work item types and states

## Security Note

Personal Access Tokens are stored in browser localStorage for convenience in this demo. In a production environment, consider implementing more secure authentication methods such as:

- Azure Active Directory integration
- OAuth 2.0 flows
- Server-side token management

## Development

### Building for Production

This project uses Playwright for end-to-end testing. Tests cover:

- Login functionality and form validation
- Kanban board display and interactions
- Work item creation and editing
- Drag and drop functionality
- Responsive design and accessibility

#### Running E2E Tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**: Ensure your Personal Access Token has the correct permissions
2. **CORS Errors**: Azure DevOps APIs support CORS for browser requests
3. **Work Items Not Loading**: Check your project name and organization URL

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your Azure DevOps permissions
- Ensure the organization URL format is correct: `https://dev.azure.com/yourorg`
