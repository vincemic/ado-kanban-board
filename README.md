## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm
- An Azure DevOps organization and project
- Personal Access Token with Work Items (read & write) permissions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ado-kanban-board
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

### Azure DevOps Setup

1. Go to your Azure DevOps organization
2. Navigate to **User Settings** > **Personal Access Tokens**
3. Create a new token with **Work Items (read & write)** permissions
4. Copy the token for use in the application

### Using the Application

1. **Login**: Enter your Azure DevOps organization name and Personal Access Token
2. **Mock Mode**: Toggle mock mode for testing with sample data (no real Azure DevOps connection required)
3. **View Board**: See your work items organized in columns by state
4. **Drag & Drop**: Move work items between columns to change their state
5. **Create Work Items**: Click the "New Work Item" button to add new items
6. **Edit Work Items**: Click on any work item to edit its details
7. **Refresh**: Use the refresh button to reload data from Azure DevOps

### Mock Mode for Testing

The application includes a mock mode for testing purposes:

- **URL Parameter**: Add `?mock=true` to any URL to enable mock mode (e.g., `http://localhost:4200/login?mock=true`)
- **Toggle Button**: Use the toggle button on the login page to switch between real and mock modes
- **Sample Data**: Mock mode provides realistic sample work items and projects
- **Local Storage**: Your mock mode preference is saved locally

Mock mode is perfect for:
- Testing the application without Azure DevOps access
- Demonstrating functionality
- Development and debugging
- E2E testing

**Note**: Query parameters are preserved when navigating directly to specific pages (e.g., `/login?mock=true`, `/board?mock=true`)

## Quick Testing

### Test with Mock Data (No Azure DevOps Required)

1. Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200?mock=true`

3. Or use the toggle button on the login page to switch to mock mode

4. When in mock mode:
   - Organization name can be anything (e.g., "testorg")
   - PAT token can be anything (e.g., "fake-token")
   - You'll see sample projects and work items
   - All drag-and-drop functionality works with mock data

### Test with Real Azure DevOps

1. Ensure you have an Azure DevOps organization and PAT token
2. Start the application normally: `ng serve`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`
4. Enter your real organization name and PAT token
5. Connect to your actual Azure DevOps projects


```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

- **Live URL**: [https://vincemic.github.io/ado-kanban-board/](https://vincemic.github.io/ado-kanban-board/)
- **Deployment**: Automatic on every push to `main` branch
- **Build Process**: Angular production build with GitHub Pages base href
- **Testing**: Playwright tests run but don't block deployment (non-blocking)

#### Continuous Integration

The repository uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

**Workflows:**
- **Playwright Tests (Non-blocking)**: Runs E2E tests on every push and PR, but failures don't block deployment
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Automatically deploys the app when changes are pushed to main

**Test Strategy:**
- Tests provide feedback on functionality
- Deployment continues even if tests fail to ensure continuous delivery
- Test failures are reported but don't prevent users from accessing the latest version
- Failed tests trigger notifications for developers to investigate and fix

This approach prioritizes availability while maintaining quality feedback loops.

#### Manual Deployment

You can manually trigger a deployment:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button

#### Local GitHub Pages Testing

To test the GitHub Pages build locally:

```bash
# Build for GitHub Pages
npm run build -- --base-href=/ado-kanban-board/

# Serve the built files (requires a local server)
npx http-server dist/ado-kanban-board
```

### Other Deployment Options

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- **Netlify**: Connect your repository for automatic deployments
